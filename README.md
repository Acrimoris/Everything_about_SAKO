# Quick history
SAKO (System Automatycznego Kodowania (Automatic Operation Coding System)) - algorithmic language of Polish computers: XYZ, ZAM-2, ZAM-21 and ZAM-41 focused on receiving an effective code. Initially, it only supported fixed decimal calculations. In the version for ZAM-21 and ZAM-41, a variable decimal point has been added.

General features of the SAKO language:
- commands similar to sentences used in natural language
- shortened the time of learning the principles of programming
- easy to use, reduced coding time
- transparent program code, low probability of making a mistake

It had a static address allocation. It was possible to insert code in SAS macro assembler.
The compilation proceeded in two stages:
1. From SAKO to SAS macro assembler.
2. From SAS to machine language.

The most characteristic feature of SAKO are Polish commands, e.g. READ, JUMP TO.
Designed primarily for programming numerical calculations. The larger systems at the Military University of Technology were transformed into a system of calculations using the finite element method.

# Why?
It took me over a dozen hours to find and collect all of this data. (I know I'm not very good at searching)<br>
I even travelled to Warsaw to find some of the information.<br>
Why am I creating this repository? For fun. I had some time off and was bored.<br>
Sorry for the bad quality of files. I had to reduce it's size because of how Github works.

# Thanks
I would like to thank especially all of the authors of the documents, redactors and helpers. Also big thanks to the creators of SAKO, and other people participating in it's creation.<br>
